Instructions: 

The two sprites are the players. The green fire guy and the pink lava girl. 

There are buttons on the ground which open up doors to jewels. 

They may be touched by either player without consequence but only the player of the correct color touching the button will open the door.

The green ground and pink ground will cause the player of the wrong color to die when stepped on so beware. 

The brown platforms may be traversed without consequence.

The doors at the top of the screen are the key to beating the level. 

Behavior:
The players should die upon contact with any platform of the wrong color. 

The buttons may be pressed by either player but should only open the door when the right color person touches it.

You can only collect gems of your own color. 

Controls:
W key should make the green man jump, and A and D should make that player move left and right respectively

Up arrow will make the pink girl jump, and left and right arrow should make the player move left and right respectively

Game Ends:
You win by both sprites collecting ALL gems of their respective color.

You may lose by making contact with the wrong color platforms. If one player dies, the game will end regardless of if the other player dies.
